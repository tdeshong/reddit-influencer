## Problem

For each brand and product, I want to identify the 10 most influential Reddit users based on the number of positive upvotes on comments mentioning the product. I believe the result would be useful for marketers (especially in small companies) as they can try to include these users into their marketing campaign. MVP is the list of users for each product with the total number of upvotes for the last week, last month, last year, and all the time (since Dec 2005).

## Repo directory structure

The directory structure for the repo should look like this:

    ├── README.md
    ├── airflow
    │   └── scheduler.py
    ├── frontend
    │   └── frontend.py
    ├── ingestion
    │   └── ingest.sh
    ├── postgres
    |   └── result.sql
    └── spark
        └── preprocess.scala
